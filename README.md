# SelfInjectiveQuiversWithPotential

SelfInjectiveQuiversWithPotential consists of two parts:
  1. A library for handling quivers with potential.
  2. A quiver editor, where the user can draw a quiver and check if the quiver induces a self-injective planar QP.

The library contains logic mostly related to two tasks:
  1. determining whether a suitable QP is self-injective, and
  2. generating QPs that are "likely" to be self-injective.
  
and its main purpose is to enable a computer search for self-injective quivers with potential.
