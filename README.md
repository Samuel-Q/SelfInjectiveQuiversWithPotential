# SelfInjectiveQuiversWithPotential

SelfInjectiveQuiversWithPotential consists of three parts:
  1. A library (the SelfInjectiveQuiversWithPotential project) for dealing with quivers and quivers with potential.
  2. A quiver editor (the SelfInjectiveQuiversWithPotentialWinForms project), where the user can draw a quiver and check if the quiver induces a self-injective planar QP.
  3. A command-line program (the SelfInjectiveQuiversWithPotentialCli project), where the user can perform various tasks (currently under development).

The library contains logic mostly related to two tasks:
  1. determining whether a suitable QP is self-injective, and
  2. generating QPs that are "likely" to be self-injective.
  
and its main purpose is to enable a computer search for self-injective quivers with potential.
